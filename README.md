# Scripts
A collection of scripts used for various tasks. Primarily to solve
simple tasks, but also a way to practice and learn different programming
languages and their idioms.

## BIN
Scripts in the `bin/` directory are written in bash.

You can add the directory to `$PATH` in your `.bash_profile`:
```bash
export SCRIPTS=$REPOS/scripts/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$SCRIPTS
```
